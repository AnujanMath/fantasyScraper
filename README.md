# Fantasy NBA Web Scraper and Team Manager :basketball:

## Overview

This was created to solve a personal issue I had while managing my fantasy basketball teams. Fantasy sports require a great deal of time to track stats and player growth, which comes with keeping up with every game. The next best substitute is to source the opinions of other players online. 

This app uses the CRUD template supplied by rishipr (https://github.com/rishipr/mern-auth) and implements the balldontlie API and Reddits OAuth 2.0 API to import players and teams before scraping fantasy news sources for updates regarding rostered players.
